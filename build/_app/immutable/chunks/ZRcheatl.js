This journey was unforgettable, both for the values I gained and for the people I met along the way."},{title:"Computer Science",description:"My passion for computer science began early, closely tied to my love for video games and technology. I've always been curious about how machines and programs work, which made me naturally comfortable with digital tools. After my culinary studies, I decided to shift towards IT by earning a technological high school diploma in STI2D with a focus on Energy and Environment. This allowed me to explore electricity, engineering, mechanics, and programming. During our projects, I consistently chose to work on autonomous robot programming rather than their physical design. I loved problem-solving, prototyping, and testing. That’s why I decided to pursue a degree in software development. I’m currently in my second year of a Bachelor of Science in IT, specializing in application development, and I’m truly passionate about what I do."}]},w={home_title:e,projects_title:t,skills_title:i,experiences_title:n,contact_title:a,status:o,aboutme:s,aboutme_text:r,cv:l,show_more:c,show_less:d,projects_details:m,projects_skills:p,projects_skills_button:g,projects:u,form:h,skills:f,experiences:v,skillsModal:y,passions:b};export{s as aboutme,r as aboutme_text,a as contact_title,l as cv,w as default,v as experiences,n as experiences_title,h as form,e as home_title,b as passions,u as projects,m as projects_details,p as projects_skills,g as projects_skills_button,t as projects_title,d as show_less,c as show_more,f as skills,y as skillsModal,i as skills_title,o as status};
